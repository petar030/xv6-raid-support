This version of xv6 includes an implementation of RAID functionality, located in the files raid.c and raid.h.
Supported RAID levels:

RAID 0 (striping)
RAID 1 (mirroring)
RAID 0+1 (striping + mirroring)
RAID 4 (dedicated parity)
RAID 5 (distributed parity)
The RAID subsystem is integrated into the xv6 kernel and provides redundancy and performance improvements for block storage operations.
